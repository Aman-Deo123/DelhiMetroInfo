# Delhi Metro Distance Checker

This is a simple Streamlit app that allows users to check the distance between two Delhi Metro stations using their latitude and longitude coordinates. The app also displays additional data and a map of metro stations.

## Features

1. **Check Distance Between Metro Stations**:
    - Users can select two metro stations from a dropdown and calculate the distance between them using the Haversine formula.
    - The result is displayed as the distance in kilometers.
2. **Check Fare Between Metro Stations**:
    - Users can select two metro stations from a dropdown and calculate the fare between them using certain pre-defined fares.
    - The result is displayed as the fare in INR.

2. **View Metro Data**:
    - Users can see the raw metro data, including information such as the station name, line, latitude, longitude, and opening date.
    - The app displays missing values and data types for the metro data.
    
3. **Visualize Metro Stations on a Map**:
    - The app provides an option to visualize all metro stations on an interactive map using Streamlitâ€™s `st.map` feature.

## Installation and Usage
